        "### Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "In the past, we have seen that the model does not have enough cadets with the correct qualifications to satisfy the mandatory requirement for some AFSCs. The mandatory requirement says that AFSC X needs Y% of their accessions to have a degree from list Z. When the model cannot meet the mandatory requirement, it simply breaks, leading to time-consuming debugging to find out which AFSC's requirement broke the model. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "Since a cadet meeting the mandatory requirement for one AFSC probably meets the mandatory requirement for another AFSC, we cannot find this answer from a simple query. One way to solve this would be to run a \"pre-solver\" after preprocessing the data but before running the Classification model integer program. The \"pre-solver\" would be an integer program itself, but it would solve for the maximum possible targets given the pool of cadets and mandatory constraints _only_. \n",

        "\n",
        "* $targets$ with dimensions $m \\times 1$, where each row is an AFSC (indexed by AFSC). For $1 \\le j \\le m$, $targets[j]$ is the target provided by A1PT for AFSC $j$\n",

        "Our goal is to find out the maximum number of \"mandatory-qualified\" cadets we can place in each AFSC. A few assumptions:\n",
        "* We are most worried about percentage fill. For a given AFSC, only accessing 1 cadet when target is 2 is much worse than only accessing 99 when target is 100.\n",
